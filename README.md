# Chef Compliance: Installation, Configuration and Operation

This repo is a repository for developing Chef Compliance.

## Abstract / Description

The Chef Compliance Installation, Configuration, and Operation course is an instructor-led course covering the Chef Compliance solution. In this course you will learn how to install and initially configure the Chef Compliance server, perform compliance scans against Windows and Linux nodes, remediate compliance issues with Chef, and run Compliance reports.

In addition, you will learn how to use InSpec to create and modify Chef Compliance profiles and learn how to locate CIS (Center for Internet Security) and DoD (Department of Defense) compliance specifications that you can use to write Chef Compliance profiles. This course includes hands-on exercises to reinforce the material.

Prerequisite: You should have attended at least Chef Essentials, Chef Fundamentals or have equivalent Chef experience prior to attending this course.


##Objectives:

After completing this course, you should be able to:

* Describe the capabilities of Chef Compliance.
* Install and initially configure the Chef Compliance server.
* Perform scans with Chef Compliance.
* Remediate compliance issues.
* Use InSpec to create, modify, and test Chef Compliance profiles.
* Schedule and run compliance reports.
* Manage users, organizations, teams and permissions.

## Learner Requirements

Attendees need a network-enabled laptop with a terminal that supports SSH and a Remote Desktop Client that supports RDP.

* Windows 7+ with [Putty](http://www.putty.org/) or [Cygwin with OpenSSH](https://www.cygwin.com/) and with [Remote Desktop Connection](http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Remote-Desktop-in-Windows-7)

* Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) with [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417?mt=12)

* Ubuntu 14.04 with [Remmina Remote Desktop Client](http://www.remmina.org/wp/)


Itâ€™s best that learners have some familiarity and comfort with the following:

* Chef Essentials or Chef Fundamentals or equivalent experience.

## Known Issues

* Module 04 - At the current moment the version of InSpec (0.9.2) that ships with Chef Development Kit (ChefDK) and the Chef Compliance Server does not properly support Windows. To complete the Group Lab defined in this module you will need to update both versions of InSpec

Login to the Compliance Server and run the following:

```
$ sudo /opt/chef-compliance/embedded/bin/gem install inspec -v 0.10.1
```

Login to the Windows Node and run the following:

```
$ gem install inspec -v 0.10.1
```
* Module 05-creating-custom-profiles is under construction so it will support ChefDK  0.11.2 (which includes inspec 0.14.2) . inspec 0.14.2 changes module 05-creating-custom-profiles to use `inspec init profile` and the new `inspec compliance upload'.

## Environment

These modules focus on getting learners engaged with the content as quickly as possible. Details on setting up these instances can be found in Appendix Z in the Instructor Kit.

### Amazon Machine Instances

This content requires the attendee to have 2 Linux Nodes and 1 Windows Node.

* Compliance - CentOS 6.7 - 1.0.3 (ami-0d6f4267)

* Compliance - Windows 2012 - 1.0.0 (ami-0af8d260)

> The CentOS AMI was generated with the following [ChefDK Image Project](https://github.com/chef-training/chefdk-fundamentals-image). The Windows AMI was generated manually based on scripts found in the the [ChefDK Image Project](https://github.com/chef-training/chefdk-fundamentals-image). If you would like access to this AMI to deliver training please contact [training@chef.io](mailto:training@chef.io) the request that includes your Amazon Account Id.

### Creating the Linux Instance

> An chef recipe that automates the creation of the workstation can be found in the [ChefDK Image](
https://github.com/chef-training/chefdk-image/blob/master/cookbooks/workstations/recipes/compliance.rb) project

* Installation of ChefDK

* Create a user named 'chef' with the password 'chef'

* Ensure the yum package repository is up-to-date

```
$ yum update -y
```

* INSTALL various editors and tools that the attendee will install: vim; emacs; nano; tree; and git.

* Install [Docker on CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/centos/)

* Allow Password Authentication

* Disable the iptables service

* Disable SELINUX

* Added an ec2 json hints file (content: `{}`) to `/etc/chef/ohai/hints/ec2.json`


### Creating the Windows Instance

The AMI was generated with the following actions:

> NOTE: The creation of the image is a manual process of executing a number of steps and then saving that current working instance as an image.

* [Change](https://support.managed.com/kb/a472/how-to-change-the-administrator-password-in-windows-server-2003-2008-r2-or-2012.aspx) the Administrator's password to "Cod3Can!"

```

* Installed the Atom FoodCritic Linter
* Installed the Atom Rubocop Linter

* Added an ec2 JSON hints file (content: `{}`) to `C:\chef\ohai\hints\ec2.json`

* Write a `kitchen-template.yml` to the "\\Users\\Administrator" that contains the following [content](https://github.com/chef-training/chef-essentials-windows/blob/master/kitchen-template.yml).

* Install the kitchen-ec2 gem

```

* Add `C:\opscode\chefdk\embedded\bin` to the PATH.

```
$LocalMachinePathRegKey = 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment'
$ChefDkEmbeddedBin = 'C:\opscode\chefdk\embedded\bin'

Push-Location
Set-Location $LocalMachinePathRegKey
$CurrentPath = (Get-ItemProperty . Path).Path
$PathWithInSpec = "$CurrentPath;$ChefDkEmbeddedBin"
Set-ItemProperty . -Name Path -Value $PathWithInSpec
Pop-Location
```

* Update the Version of InSpec to a known working version

```
Invoke-Expression "chef gem install inspec -v 0.10.1"
```

* Enable remote administration via WINRM

```
